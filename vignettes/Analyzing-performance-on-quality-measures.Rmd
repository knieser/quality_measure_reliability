# Introduction
This vignette shows how to use the functions in QMRel to analzye quality measure performance.

First we'll simulate some data.

```{r}
df <- simulateData()

```


# Calculate measure performance


# Plot number of observations per provider


# Plot measure performance



# Identify high- and low-performing entities


# Calculate risk-standardized performance


# Plot risk-standardized performance



# Identify high- and low-performing entities after risk-adjustment
