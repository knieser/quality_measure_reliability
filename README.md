## About the package

This R package includes functions for calculating measure performance, both unadjusted and adjusted, and estimating reliability with several different methods. 

Several example data sets are also included: 
* `example_df_1`: This is a simulated data set generated by `simulateData()` with 100 accountable entities, an average of 50 observations per entity, a marginal outcome rate of 0.2, a median reliability of 0.7, and a regression coefficient of 0 for the covariate.
* `example_df_2`: This is another simulated data set generated by `simulateData()` with 100 accountable entities, an average of 50 observations per entity, a marginal outcome rate of 0.2, and a median reliability of 0.7, and a regression coefficient of log(1.5) for the covariate.
* `colonoscopy`: This is a data set aggregated to the entity-level. These data are from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). They contain the percentage of patients receiving appropriate recommendation for follow-up screening colonoscopy in calendar year 2023.
* `psychreadmission`: This is a data set aggregated to the entity-level. These data are from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and show the percentage of patients who return to a hospital for an unplanned inpatient stay after discharge. Data are from 07/01/2021 to 06/30/2023.

Please email me at nieser\@stanford.edu with any issues, questions, or feedback! 
I'd be happy to chat and learn how I can make this package better.

## Installing the package

`QualityMeasure` version 2.0.1 is now available to download directly from CRAN.

``` r
install.packages('QualityMeasure')
library(QualityMeasure)
```

Or, download the latest development version of the package from this repo:

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github('knieser/quality_measure_reliability')
library(QualityMeasure)
```

## Vignettes

Check out the [tutorial vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/QualityMeasure/vignettes/Tutorial.html) which walks through some examples how this package can be used to estimate entity-level reliability.

There are also two vignettes with examples using publicly available aggregated data sets. Note that because these publicly available data are already aggregated to the entity-level, not all reliability methods are appropriate to use: 
* [Colonoscopy follow-up measure](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/QualityMeasure/vignettes/Colonoscopy_Measure_Example.html) 
* [Readmission after Psychiatric Hospitalizations measure](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/QualityMeasure/vignettes/Psych_Readmission_Rate_Example.html)
